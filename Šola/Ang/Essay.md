Introduction: strong clear statement **ABOUT THE TOPPIC**  that you later develop
Body: develop points from the introduction. Write everything you want to, no personal opinion. Split points up into pros and cons. 
Conclusion: Sum everything up, *don't add anything new* , its okay to take a stance in the end but you don't have to.

Often you will have the question: "How far do you agree/disagree with the given statement" - that just refers to finding the pros and cons. You can only briefly express your opinion in the conclusion, but you don't have to

Don't: 
- I think, I believe - no opinion
- on the other hand - better to split points up no expressing opposites in the same sentence 
- use don't, shouldn't, ... do not, should not
- using abbreviations (like AI) if the essay is about AI you should explain the abbreviation in the start by saying AI (artificial intelligence) and then you can use it. 

Do:
- authentic collocations (besedne zveze) bring you extra points 
- linking words (moreover, nonetheless, in addition, firstly, ...) brings you points
