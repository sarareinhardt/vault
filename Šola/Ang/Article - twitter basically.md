##### Drugs? Yes why not
The legalization of soft drugs has recently been an active topic in the European union. Legalization has sparked  debate, with people considering both its advantages and disadvantages. In our discussion in class we came to the conclusion that there are more positives then negatives.

Whether or not you believe an adult should have the personal freedom of choosing  to use soft drugs the fact is that it is relatively easy to get to them even if they aren't legal. We think the biggest benefit of providing legal access to soft drugs is that it would weaken the existing illegal drug market, that also connects to hard drugs which are far more problematic. It would also enable the monitization of sales and collect tax revenue from purchases. Legalization would allow for regulation of the drug's purity and strength preventing users from unknowingly consuming dangerous additives making it safer. On top of that we also think that legalization would promote talk about safe use of those drugs. Even though it's not as easy to accidentally overdose on soft drugs it is important to talk about the safe use of them  similarly to alcohol beyond just saying 'don't do it'. 

We all know using drugs is bad for our health, but we see many benefits in the legalization such as reducing illegal trade, increasing public safety, generating tax revenue, and promoting responsible use.


##### Do schools prepare us for real life?
All of us have attended some form of education as it is mandatory in our country. But does the knowledge presented to us truly help us in the real world? Me and a few other students from my high school asked ourselves that question.

We immediately thought of some obvious ways the skills learnt in earlier stages of education are helpful in every day life - such as reading, writing, basic math as so on. There are also noticeable ways in wich trade schools, collage and university prepare us for our jobs by giving us a basic skillset needed to be able to start working in our chosen field. But what about grammar schools? Sometimes we as students of a grammar school feel like its completely useless to learn some information and to some point we stand with that statement even after our discussion. The reality is that i you aren't going to study a specific subject or something related to it you most likely won't use the knowledge. It is seen as some form of general education an intellectualy equipped individual is expected to have - especially in history. I am pointing out history specifically because it seemed important to us for an individual to be educated on history, as it helps you see a bigger picture in politics and so on. We do think it would be a great benefit if students were able to choose what subjects they want to study after seeing what interests them /with some mandatory ones of course) and devote the remaining time to basic life skills like how to pay bills, the organization of our country and how to vote and other practical skills.

To conclude we do think you won't use much of the information you learn in school but it is good to hear some of it. On the other hand we think some time should be devoted to familiarizing us with basic skills everyone will need later in life. We'd also love to have more selectability with the classes we take and think will help us.

**Do Schools Prepare Us for Real Life?**

All of us have attended some form of education, as it is mandatory in our country. But does the knowledge presented to us truly help in the real world? A few other students from my high school and I asked ourselves that question.

We immediately thought of some obvious ways that early education helps in everyday life – reading, writing, basic math, and so on. Trade schools, college, and university also clearly prepare us for specific jobs by giving us the necessary skills to enter the workforce. But what about grammar schools?

As students in a grammar school, we sometimes feel that it’s completely useless to learn certain information. In our discussion, many of us agreed that if you do not plan to study a subject further, you likely won’t use that knowledge again. Much of it is seen as general education that a well-rounded person is expected to have – especially subjects like history. We all agreed that history is still important, as it helps us understand politics and society more clearly.

Still, we believe it would be beneficial if students had more choice in what they study, once they discover their interests. Of course, there should still be some mandatory subjects, but more time should be dedicated to practical skills like paying bills, understanding how our country is organized, how to vote, and other real-life responsibilities.

In conclusion, although not everything we learn in school is useful later in life, it does help shape us as individuals. However, we feel that the education system should offer more flexibility and focus on life skills that every student will eventually need.
