##### Drugs? Yes why not
The legalization of drugs has recently been an active topic in the European union. Legalization has sparked  debate, with people carefully considering both its advantages and disadvantages. In our discussion in class we came to the conclusion that there are more positives then negatives.

Regardless if you believe an adult should have the personal freedom of choosing weather to use those drugs or not the fact is that it is relatively easy to get to them even if they aren't legal. We think a big benefit of providing legal access to soft drugs is that it would weaken the existing illegal drug market which also connects to hard drugs which are far more problematic. It would also enable the monitization of sales and collect tax revenue from purchases. I think that legalization would also promote talk about safe use of those drugs. Even though it's not as easy to accidentally overdose on the drugs it is important to talk about the safe use of them
