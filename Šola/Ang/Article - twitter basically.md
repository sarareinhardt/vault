##### Drugs? Yes why not
The legalization of soft drugs has recently been an active topic in the European union. Legalization has sparked  debate, with people considering both its advantages and disadvantages. In our discussion in class we came to the conclusion that there are more positives then negatives.

Whether or not you believe an adult should have the personal freedom of choosing  to use soft drugs the fact is that it is relatively easy to get to them even if they aren't legal. We think the biggest benefit of providing legal access to soft drugs is that it would weaken the existing illegal drug market, that also connects to hard drugs which are far more problematic. It would also enable the monitization of sales and collect tax revenue from purchases. Legalization would allow for regulation of the drug's purity and strength preventing users from unknowingly consuming dangerous additives making it safer. On top of that we also think that legalization would promote talk about safe use of those drugs. Even though it's not as easy to accidentally overdose on soft drugs it is important to talk about the safe use of them  similarly to alcohol beyond just saying 'don't do it'. 

We all know using drugs is bad for our health, but we see many benefits in the legalization such as reducing illegal trade, increasing public safety, generating tax revenue, and promoting responsible use.
