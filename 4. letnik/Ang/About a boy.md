**Chapter 1**
1. How does the story begin? Where are Marcus and his mother Fiona and how do they live? 
   Fiona and Rodger split up and Marcus asked about it ('have you split up'). They moved London from Cambridge which meant a new life and for Marcus a new school. We learn that Fiona has a lot of problems. She is 38. They aren't verry rich. They live alone in an apartment.
2. What can we say about the relationship between Fiona and Marcus?
   Not great, Fiona had a lot of problems, so Marcus couldn't come to her with his own problems that the had (about school) which he needed help with. Despite that they were verry connected, as they are all they have. We get the feeling that Marcus is taking care of Fiona.
3. When did his parents get divorced?
   Marcuse's parents divorced 4 yrs ago when he was 8.
4. How did the divorce affect Marcus? How does any divorce affect children?
   He had to move schools, was missing a father figure, which is evident when he turned to Will to fill the role. Usually it affect children poorly, because they usually end up missing a parent figure like Marcus or have a hard time communicating problems from their own life to parents if they are used to associating a certain type of problem with mom/dad. They also lack a role model for what their relationships should/could look like in the future.

**Chapter 2**
1.  Introduce Will Freeman. How does he live? 
   Will freeman is a 36 year old relatively self centered man living alone, single. He lives off the royalties of the song that his father wrote called Santa's Super Sleigh. He likes going to the movies, he likes to watch countdown on TV at home. He has an expensive car, wears fashionable clothes...He has a lot of short term relationtships with women
2. What was it like for Will when he visited his friends John and Christine?
   He didn't enjoy the visit. He wondered why people would even have children when he saw the chaos that their 1st child already caused in their home and especially why they would have another one after that.
3. What did John and Christine ask Will? How did he react?
   They asked weather he'd like to be Ned's godfather. He wasn't a fan of the idea
   'Listen. I'm touched that you asked. But I can't think of anything worse. Seriously. It's just not my sort of thing.'

**Chapter 3**
1. Why did Marcus wish to be Macauley Culkin? Macauley Culkin = the boy from home alone  
   Because Macaulay Culkin didn't have to go to school. He was taught in a "caravan sort of thing". He also earned more than his mum, so his mum would be able to quit her job and teach him.
2. What was it like for him at school?
   Horrible. Kids were mean to him, bullying him, and he couldn't even come to his mom with his school problems, as she already had so many of her own.

**Chapter 4**
1. How did Will embarrass himself? What followed the embarrassment?
   Will embarrassed himself at the SPAT meeting when he pretended to be a single father and then got caught out by asking stupid, obviously fake questions about raising a child — his lies made him look ridiculous.  After that embarrassment, the women there felt sorry for him and one of them (Angie) actually agreed to meet him again — so the embarrassment _weirdly helped him
2. How did Will react when they had a date and she immediately told him she had children?
   Inside, he panicked — he felt uncomfortable and didn’t WANT a woman with kids.  But he didn’t admit that — he faked being “ok with it” to keep up his fake single-dad act.
3. What did Will realize after a few dates with Angie and her children?
   He loved it. The kids loved him, he played with them, he could enjoy dating Angie. He realized he could go home and enjoy his peace. And then she even broke up with him and he wouldn't have to be the bad guy.
 4. Why was it easier for Will than before when, after six weeks of dating, they broke up?
    It was easier because **he wasn’t emotionally involved**.  
    He was acting — it wasn’t a real relationship for him.  
    So when it ended, he didn’t feel heartbreak or loss.
 5. What did he realize about himself after breaking up with Angie?
He realized that he was **empty inside** — he had nothing real going on in his life.  
He saw that his “life” was basically shallow hobbies and entertainment — no meaning, no purpose, no real relationships.

**Chapter 5**
1. His mother started crying before before breakfast. It was different as she never cried in the morning previously and he didn't know what to do (just like every other time it  happend).
2. On the way to school he tried to work out what was wrong with her. And what would be wrong that he wouldn't know ab. He was looking for reasons. She was a music therapist for handicapped children - she had enough money and so on so he couldn't figure it out
