##### Chapter 1
1. **How does the story begin?** 
   Where are Marcus and his mother Fiona and how do they live? 
   Fiona and Rodger split up and Marcus asked about it ('have you split up'). They moved London from Cambridge which meant a new life and for Marcus a new school. We learn that Fiona has a lot of problems. She is 38. They aren't verry rich. They live alone in an apartment.
2. **What can we say about the relationship between Fiona and Marcus?**
   Not great, Fiona had a lot of problems, so Marcus couldn't come to her with his own problems that the had (about school) which he needed help with. Despite that they were verry connected, as they are all they have. We get the feeling that Marcus is taking care of Fiona.
3. **When did his parents get divorced?**
   Marcuse's parents divorced 4 yrs ago when he was 8.
4. **How did the divorce affect Marcus? How does any divorce affect children?**
   He had to move schools, was missing a father figure, which is evident when he turned to Will to fill the role. Usually it affect children poorly, because they usually end up missing a parent figure like Marcus or have a hard time communicating problems from their own life to parents if they are used to associating a certain type of problem with mom/dad. They also lack a role model for what their relationships should/could look like in the future.

##### Chapter 2
1.  **Introduce Will Freeman. How does he live?** 
   Will freeman is a 36 year old relatively self centered man living alone, single. He lives off the royalties of the song that his father wrote called Santa's Super Sleigh. He likes going to the movies, he likes to watch countdown on TV at home. He has an expensive car, wears fashionable clothes...He has a lot of short term relationtships with women
2. **What was it like for Will when he visited his friends John and Christine?**
   He didn't enjoy the visit. He wondered why people would even have children when he saw the chaos that their 1st child already caused in their home and especially why they would have another one after that.
3. **What did John and Christine ask Will? How did he react?**
   They asked weather he'd like to be Ned's godfather. He wasn't a fan of the idea
   'Listen. I'm touched that you asked. But I can't think of anything worse. Seriously. It's just not my sort of thing.'

##### Chapter 3
1. **Why did Marcus wish to be Macauley Culkin?** 
   Macauley Culkin = the boy from home alone  
   Because Macaulay Culkin didn't have to go to school. He was taught in a "caravan sort of thing". He also earned more than his mum, so his mum would be able to quit her job and teach him.
2. **What was it like for him at school?**
   Horrible. Kids were mean to him, bullying him, and he couldn't even come to his mom with his school problems, as she already had so many of her own.

##### Chapter 4
1. How did Will embarrass himself? What followed the embarrassment?
   Will embarrassed himself at the SPAT meeting when he pretended to be a single father and then got caught out by asking stupid, obviously fake questions about raising a child — his lies made him look ridiculous.  After that embarrassment, the women there felt sorry for him and one of them (Angie) actually agreed to meet him again — so the embarrassment _weirdly helped him
2. How did Will react when they had a date and she immediately told him she had children?
   Inside, he panicked — he felt uncomfortable and didn’t WANT a woman with kids.  But he didn’t admit that — he faked being “ok with it” to keep up his fake single-dad act.
3. What did Will realize after a few dates with Angie and her children?
   He loved it. The kids loved him, he played with them, he could enjoy dating Angie. He realized he could go home and enjoy his peace. And then she even broke up with him and he wouldn't have to be the bad guy.
 4. Why was it easier for Will than before when, after six weeks of dating, they broke up?
    It was easier because **he wasn’t emotionally involved**.  
    He was acting — it wasn’t a real relationship for him.  
    So when it ended, he didn’t feel heartbreak or loss.
 
5. **What did he realize about himself after breaking up with Angie?**
He realized that he was **empty inside** — he had nothing real going on in his life.  
He saw that his “life” was basically shallow hobbies and entertainment — no meaning, no purpose, no real relationships.

##### Chapter 5
1. His mother started crying before before breakfast. It was different as she never cried in the morning previously and he didn't know what to do (just like every other time it  happend). The atmosphere was heavy and tense.  Marcus sensed something was wrong and tried to behave extra “normal” and “adult” – he tried to keep things calm.
2. On the way to school he tried to work out what was wrong with her. And what would be wrong that he wouldn't know ab. He was looking for reasons. She was a music therapist for handicapped children - she had enough money and so on so he couldn't figure it out

**4) Why did Nicky and Mark want to stop hanging out with Marcus?**  
Because being seen with Marcus made them a target too.  
If they were with him, the bullies also bullied them.

##### **Chapter 6**

**1) “I'm a single father. I have a two-year-old boy.” – What was Will’s plan?**  
His plan was to pretend he had a child to get close to single mothers because he found them attractive.  
It was a strategy to meet women. He invented Ned - a 2 yr old. 

**2) What was SPAT? What was it like for Will at his first meeting?**  
SPAT = Single Parents – Alone Together.  
It was a support group for single parents.  
Will found it awkward, embarrassing and full of “emotional talk” he disliked. He was also worried that he'd be recognised as a fraud, as he didn't know how to take care of babies. The 1st mistake he made was, that he was on time.

**3) Who did he pick? Why?**  
He picked Suzie – because she seemed attractive and “normal”, she had long blond hair. She was another one with a verry bad experience with men. She was married to a man called Dan who left a day before she gave birth and also had an affair when she was 6 months pregnant.

**4) Were there any other men at the meeting?**  
No – he was the only man. There was one called Jeremy, but he wasn't present in the meeting. His wife was killed.



##### **Chapter 7**

**1) What was it like for Marcus when he visited his Dad in Cambridge?**  
(His dad's name is Clive). Disappointing – awkward – boring.   
His father wasn’t close to him, and Marcus felt out of place.

**2) What was it like at the newsagent’s on the way home?**  
Bad – the boys (bullies) were there. He was just browsing some magazines and without being aware he started singing. They started humming, they stuffed things into his pockets and accused him of stealing. 

**3) How did he react to the bullies and what did they do to him?**  
He tried to walk past them without eye contact.  
They mocked him, insulted him and threw a piece of bread at him.

**4) What did the shop owner do?**  
The shop owner was nice, and said he saw what they did. He advised Marcus to keep out of their way

**5) What was it like when he got home?**  
Horrible – he found his mother crying. 

**6) How was his response to his mother’s condition responsible?**  
He held her accountable for not caring for him. First he said stop it and then he said if you can't take care of me find someone who can, which hurt Fiona a lot and 

**7) What happened afterwards?**  
It sobered her up, pulled herself together and made dinner. She was planning for Marcus to go to the SPAT picnic with Suzie, but Fiona would stay home

**8) How did he feel about SPAT?**  
He didn't like SPAT because of the "horrible kids"  (only bad thing about them was that they were young). He didn't mind that he was going with Suzie. Here Fiona also hurt Marcus when she said to Marcus, that they don't do each other any good.



##### **Chapter 8**

**1) How did Will feel when Suzie criticised his “ex-wife”?**  
He was guilty, uncomfortable and nervous (because the “ex-wife” and child didn’t exist). He realized the plan would be way more difficult to execute.

**2) What was Will’s response to Suzie’s question about his work?**  
At first he wanted to lie, but then he realized it was too much to keep track of all the lies, so he just told her the truth. He said he did nothing, and told her about Santa's super sleigh. 

**3) How did Marcus and Will start a conversation?**  
He mentioned Michael Jackson and how much money he made off of royalties, and wanted to know how much Will made, but Suzie stopped him.

**4) What was Will’s first impression of Marcus?**  
Weird, badly dressed, socially awkward, doesn't get sarcasm...

**5) What was it like at the SPAT picnic?**  
He was playing with the kids, and everyone seemed to thing he was super caring


##### **Chapter 9**

**1) What happened after the duck was killed?**  
Marcus was upset and will said he was dumb for throwing the large piece of bread at it..

**2) What surprised and pleased Marcus?**  
Will lied for Marcus. Marcus appreciated that he stood up for him

**3) Why did Suzie go with Marcus to his flat? What did they find?**  
She had a feeling something would be wrong. They found his mom half on the floor half on the couch in her vomit. Marcus froze. He was in shock and he didn't really know what's going on.  

**4) How did Suzie react?**  
She started slapping Fiona and said "How could you, you have a kid"...

**5) How did his mother’s attempted suicide affect Marcus?**  
It was the most terrifying thing he had ever experienced. He was aware that the experience would stick with him for life.


##### **Chapter 10**

**1) How did Will react to the situation afterwards?**  
Surprisingly mature – he stayed and supported Marcus. He drove Marcus and Suzie's baby to the hospital, because Suzie needed to go with Fiona

**2) What changed in Marcus at the hospital?**  
He was no longer a 12 yr old, but he was an old 12 yr old

**3) What did Marcus notice in the waiting room?**  
He noticed that everyone else were sort of dead beats (drunks, ...) He didn't want that to be asociated with his mum. He felt that she doesn't belong there

**4) How did Suzie help Marcus?**  
She stayed with him, talked to him honestly, comforted him, gave him emotional support. She had him stay the night with her.


##### **Chapter 11**

**1) How did Marcus react to his mother’s suicide letter?**  
He was angry, and verry maturely, he wanted to talk it out. He was afraid about the future. Fiona said she felt better at the moment but he asked "what about after you have your tea"

**2) How did they spend the evening?**  
They had dinner and watched a movie. He was really cautious when he was picking the film, as he wanted it not to have any references to suicide, but he picked the wrong one... 

**3) What happened while watching a film?**  
When it came to the suicide part he stopped the movie. He was surprised, because Fiona didn't even make the connection at first. She wanted him to keep playing the movie and Marcus couldn't shake the feeling that there was something wrong with her (how could she not make the connection??)

##### **Chapter 12**






##### **Chapter 15**
1) Started wondering what Will will give him in exchange. He manipulated him into accepting him into his apartment by blackmailing him with telling his mum that he doesn't have a kid. They bonded
2) They talked about school, Marcus was wondering why Will would even go to school, as he had money and didn't need education to get a job
3) He is trying to tell him, that he should fit in. His mum is in charge of how he looks. Will is trying to tell him to grow up and to make his own decisions about his appearance. It's funny for Will to say that, as he is really childish, but it is good advice. Fiona isn't doing this on purpose, but she doesn't think about it.
4) The conversations were getting deeper and more serious. Marcus felt some kind of security, warmth or even belonging. He was able to talk about things he couldn't talk about with anyone else. 
5) He was searching for comfort. He was trying to postpone him coming home. He was afraid of what he might find at home.
6) That somebody would promise him his mums suicide (attempt) would never happen again. But no one could do that. 
7) All he said was "fucking hell". Will was a good person to talk about this because he wasn't se connected to the family, he didn't dig into his problems like Suzie or his mum would. Only saying that made him show compassion, he sort of reassured him that it was messed up so he didn't feel crazy, but didn't overanalyze it.

##### **Chapter 16**
1) Marcus once randomly said, that his father stopped drinking coffee. Will realized he hadn't really thought about Marcuse's dad, as he seemed so much like a 'product of his mum' Marcus then wanted to talk about him more, as he couldn't really talk about him at home and Will asked some additional questions. He learned that he worked in some kind of social services, that he had a new gf called Lindsey, he didn't earn much and Marcus got to see him ever so often
2) That he never had any problems in life. He didn't see this as something shameful, but he was sort of proud of it.
3) Marcus. He was surrounded by bullies throwing rock hard sweets at him. Marcus lead them to wills place, because he didn't want to go home and show them where he lived, but he also knew will would do something as an adult. He was aware that at home he might not be protected. He knew going to Wills' would be a safer option.
4) "Never mind who am I, who are you?"  ...?
5) Will advised him to blend in with others to fit (that's when he bought him the sneakers).  He told him he could be as weird as he wants on the inside, but he told him to do something about the outside.
6) Shoes
7) He didn't really care... Shoes were shoes. He just sort of trusted will with the process. He did think about his mum judging him for being a sheep but if it would work he'd consider it worth it.
8) Adidas basketball boots 60 pounds. Fiona would never buy him the shoes, not necesarily because of him being a sheep, but because of the cost. At the end he still looked weird, the shoes now didn't match the rest of him, but at least it was a start.
9) He was beaming in his own "munificence" (the quality or action of being extremely generous.)
10) The following day Marcus turned up at Will's door, tearful, a pair of soggy black socks where his
    Adidas basketball boots should have been; they'd stolen them, of course.

##### **Chapter 17**
1) No. She never noticed them when they were there.
2) Yep. He told her he had nice shoes, that they were stolen, that will bought them, that he visited him after school, that he doesn't really have a kid
3) She (in rage) made Marcus put his shoes on and they went straight to wills place.
4) He went red in the face and started shouting very loud. 'I don't have any fucking choice, do I? Your son comes round fucking uninvited every night. Sometimes he's pursued by gangs of savages. I could leave him outside to take his chances, but I've been letting him in for his own safety. I won't fucking bother next time. Sod the pair of you. Now, if you've finished, you can
piss off.'
5) He told her Marcus was having trouble at school and being "eaten alive at school, you know. They take him to pieces every single fucking day of the week, and you're worried about where his trainers come from and whether I'm molesting him."
6) Marcus hadn't enjoyed the afternoon's rows, but when they had finished he could see the point of them.  
7) He made the 2 random noises to prevent will from talking about the hospital.
8) She told him not to visit will again which he understood was somewhat reasonable from her pov, but he argued about it anyway
9) Every time he thought about this, it came back to the same problem: there were only two of them, and at least — at least — one of them was nuts.





##### **Chapter 18**
1) Santa’s Super Sleigh started playing. It was a new record. A woman started playing it on the violin at Angel station.
2) Carolers singing the song, asking for money.
3) She started saying mad things.  Marcus doesn’t need a father – not like you. Will was confused. She tells him Marcus wants adult male company. She kinda wants Will to be in his life, at the same time doesn’t. She wants to talk about the situation.
4) This was the first time he was out with a woman he didn’t find attractive. He didn’t flirt, he was absorbed in the convo.
5) They talked about Marcus wanting male company. Will said it was just “an attack” at her, he doesn’t really need it. They agreed it was best if Marcus & Will don’t see each other again?

   ##### Chapter 19
 1) Why didn’t Marcus want Will and his mom to talk anymore?
	Marcus was afraid that if his mum and Will talked, **they would bring up things that could cause trouble**.  
	He didn’t want Will to mention Marcus’s attempt at blackmail, he didn’t want his mum talking about how much TV he watched, and he didn’t want them discussing the hospital because it might make his mum “go funny again.”  
	Basically, **every possible topic felt dangerous**, so he wanted them to stop talking.

2. Who was Ellie?
	Ellie McCrae was a **year-ten girl**, known for being **rebellious, scruffy, sulky**, and **constantly in trouble**.  
	She cut her own hair, wore black lipstick, and had a reputation that made her “famous” at school. She was older then Marcus. They met randomly. They met in front of the headmistresses office. He was supposed to meet with the headmistress because of the stolen shoes. Ellie was also there. He remembered his mum told him to try to meet people from school 

3. Why did Ellie have to see the Headmistress?
	Ellie had to see Mrs Morrison because of her **sweatshirt**, which **did not have the school logo**. She was instead wearing a Kurt Cobain sweatshirt, and she refused to take it off, so the school saw it as a disciplinary issue. Marcus misheard the name. he heard Kirk O’Bane

4. What was it like for Marcus when he met Mrs Morrison?
	The meeting went badly.  
	Mrs. Morrison suggested he should “try keeping out of their way,” which Marcus found stupid and insulting, because he obviously thought of that.  
	He became frustrated, **lost his temper**, and eventually **walked out**, which made him feel oddly free and excited — as if he were “letting go” and becoming someone different, even a truant. ("sit down young man, I'm not done with you" and Marcus replied "I'm done with you") He felt great because he finally stood up for himself. He then went and skipped school.

##### Chapter 20
1. Will liked driving around London because he enjoyed the traffic, the feeling of being part of the city, knowing his way around, and being able to play loud music in the car without disturbing anyone. He listened to Nirvana. He was listening to it verry loudly, which he couldn't do at home, as his neighbors would protest it
    
2. He saw Marcus while driving, but he didn’t stop the car. Even though he felt a sudden affection for Marcus, he preferred not to stop because it was easier to stay fond of him from a distance. He was concerned, because he knew he should be at school.
    
3. Later in the afternoon, at exactly 4:15, Marcus buzzed Will’s door. He had clearly timed it perfectly so it wouldn’t look suspicious that he had skipped school. Eventually he did get in despite Will
    
4. Will didn’t let him in at first, ignoring the buzzer several times. After Marcus buzzed nonstop for over thirty minutes, Will finally gave up and let him in.
    
5. When Will asked Marcus about school, Marcus tried to lie. Will then revealed he had seen Marcus skipping that afternoon. Marcus panicked and blamed Mrs Morrison for telling him to keep away from the bullies.
    
6. Marcus asked Will to go and see Ms. Morrison
    
7.**What did Will realise about Marcus** 
	   Will realized that Marcus didn’t need a father figure to teach him how to grow up — he needed someone to help him be a kid, understand basic things other kids knew, and survive school socially. He could do that. He needed to know things like popular music, fashion, ...

##### Chapter 20
- **Why was Ellie still teasing Marcus?**  
    Ellie was still teasing Marcus because she thought he was funny. She and her friend enjoyed the way he spoke and how seriously he took everything. His reactions amused them, so they kept joking with him.
    
- **Did Marcus like Nirvana?**  
    At first Marcus didn’t really like Nirvana — it sounded like noise to him. But after listening more, he began to understand it a bit and could hear some of the tune. He didn’t love it, but he could see why someone like Ellie might like their music.
    
- **How did Marcus start building a bond with Ellie?**  
    Marcus started building a bond with Ellie by talking to her at the vending machine, trying to join in with her jokes, and unintentionally making her and her friend laugh. The girls found him amusing and interesting, and Ellie began to include him, defend him, and even call him her friend. This made Marcus feel accepted for the first time.
##### Chapter 21
- **Why was Ellie still teasing Marcus?**  
    Ellie was still teasing Marcus because she and her friend found him funny. His seriousness, the way he answered questions, and how he didn’t understand their jokes made them laugh, so they kept teasing him in a playful way.
    
- **Did Marcus like Nirvana?**  
    Marcus didn’t really like Nirvana at first — it mostly sounded like noise to him. But after hearing more, he could pick out the tune and understand why someone like Ellie might enjoy them, even though he still preferred the music he normally listened to. He was still interested in Nirvana, because Ellie liked it
    
- **How did Marcus start building a bond with Ellie?**  
    Marcus began building a bond with Ellie by talking to her at the vending machine, trying to join her jokes, and unintentionally making her and her friend (Zoe) laugh. They enjoyed his odd sense of humour, included him in conversations, stood up for him, and even publicly called him their friend. This made Marcus feel accepted and closer to Ellie. They constantly bumped into each other which helped strengthen the bond. Ellie also protected Marcus by 
##### Chapter 22
- **How did Will try to avoid Christmas?**  
    Will originally planned to avoid Christmas by staying alone, watching movies, getting drunk and smoking joints. But he began to feel that spending Christmas alone like that made his life look sad, so he tried to avoid ending up with Fiona and Marcus—and then accidentally accepted Marcus’s invitation anyway.
    
- **What was it like at Christmas dinner?**  
    Christmas dinner was crowded but surprisingly pleasant. Fiona, Clive, Lindsey, Lindsey’s mum, Marcus, and Will all sat together. Will expected it to be awkward with just Marcus and his mum, but instead everyone tried to be friendly and get along. It wasn’t perfect, but it made Marcus happy, and even Will enjoyed the temporary harmony before the arguments eventually started.
    
- **What presents did Will bring for Fiona and Marcus?**  
    Will brought Marcus a vinyl record of _Nevermind_ and a Kurt Cobain T-shirt. He brought Fiona a stylish and expensive glass vase for her flowers. Fiona gave will a book called Single Parent's Handbook as a joke
    
- **How did Will change his mind about Marcus?**  
    Will realized Marcus was actually a good kid — thoughtful, grateful, and able to appreciate gifts even when they weren’t exciting. He saw that Marcus saw the world differently from other people, not with cynicism but with genuine appreciation. This made Will feel differently about him and see him in a kinder, more understanding way.
##### Chapter 23
- **How was Christmas different for Marcus?**  
    Christmas was different for Marcus because it felt more like a lively party than a small family day. He got “serious” presents from his mum and fun ones from his dad, and with Will, Lindsey, and Lindsey’s mum there, the room felt full and busy. He liked the mix — it felt bigger, happier, and less boring than it would have been if it were just him and his mum. That was until Clive (Marcuse's dad) started to roll a joint. Fiona was angry that he was doing that in front of Marcus
    
- **Who else came to the party? How did Will feel?**  
    Clive (Marcus’s dad), Lindsey, and Lindsey’s mum all came to the party. Later, Suzie and her daughter Megan arrived too.  
    At first, Will felt surprisingly comfortable and even part of the group. But after the row about Clive’s joint, and especially when Suzie arrived and snubbed him, he felt awkward, embarrassed, and suddenly separate from everyone else.
    
- **What did Megan do?**  
    Megan walked around the Christmas tree and chose someone to give a present to. She handed a gift to Will and made him open it with her. This forced Will into an uncomfortable interaction with her and with Suzie, who told him to “play with her.”
    
- **How did the conversation between Will and Suzie continue?**  
    Their conversation was tense and awkward. Suzie ignored Will at first, then criticised him, saying he should learn how to play with kids and mocking him about his fake “Ned” story and pretending to be a single parent. Will got defensive and irritated, which made the atmosphere even more strained.
    
- **How and why did Marcus take Will’s side?**  
    Marcus stood up for Will by arguing that Will had been kind to him — he listened to Marcus, helped him with the shoe problem, bought him trainers, and understood things like Kurt Cobain. Marcus said it wasn’t fair that Will was being attacked when he was the only guest Marcus himself had invited. He defended Will because he genuinely cared about him and didn’t want him to be driven away.
