Will - 36
chapter 1
1. Fiona and Rodger split up and Marcus asked about it ('have you split up'). They moved London from Cambridge which meant a new life and for Marcus a new school. We learn that Fiona has a lot of problems. She is 38. They aren't verry rich. They live alone in an apartment.
2. Not great, Fiona had a lot of problems, so Marcus couldn't come to her with his own problems that the had (about school) which he needed help with. Despite that they were verry connected, as they are all they have.
3. Marcuse's dad used drugs, which Fiona didn't like.
4. He was missing a father figure, which is evident when he turned to Will to fill the role. Usually it affect children poorly, because they usually end up missing a parent figure like Marcus or have a hard time communicating problems from their own life to parents if they are used to associating a certain type of problem with mom/dad. They also lack a role model for what their relationships should/could look like in the future.

Chapter 2
1.  Will freeman is a 36 year old relatively self centered man living alone, single. He lives off the royalties of the song that his father wrote called Santa's Super Sleigh.
2. He didn't enjoy the visit. He wondered why people would even have children when he saw the chaos that their 1st child already caused in their home and especially why they would have another one after that.
