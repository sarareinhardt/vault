##### Standard and alternative medicine
Disadvantages of standard medicine - too many pills

Alternative medicine:
focused on maintaining health before the point of dysfunction
- herbal medicine
- meditation - releasing stress
- acupuncture *only one c*
- acupressure
- hypnosis - effective when people suffer from something traumatic that happend years before and they push it to the back of their mind. With hypnosis you bring back that memory to life and hopefully solve whatever is the problem.

Do u think alternative medicines are tried tested and safe? It is not officially tested and it isn't under control. A lot of people claim they are professionals when they aren't and they end up doing more harm then good.

Do you think doctors should study about and be experts in alternative medicine? Yes to be able to appoint you to someone and be experts so they can be trusted and not harm you as said before

Standard/western/contemporary medicine = includes modern health science, medical technology, etc More drug and surgery oriented
