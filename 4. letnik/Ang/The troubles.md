**A divided society**
On one side
- unionists
- loyalists
- mostly protestant
- feeling of being British
- want to remain part of the UK
On the other side:
- nationalists
- republicans
- mostly Roman Catholic
- feeling of being Irish
- want to be part of united Ireland

**The formation of Northern Ireland
- Created by the government of Ireland act 1920
- Became a legal entity on 3rd may 1921
- Formed from 6 of the 9 *counties* of the *province* of Ulster
- Protestant majority
- "A protestant parlament for a protestant people"

**The fight for civil rights**
- Catholics/nationalists areas were overlooked for investment
- Individuals had problems connected to:
	- housing (catholic families tend to be bigger)
	- employment (they didn't directly ask you what religion you believe, but they asked which school you went to (some schools were catholic, some were protestant))
	- Legal rights
	- Political representation (Gerymandering)
- Attempts to reform and improve the conditions were opposed by *hardline* Protestants/unionists

**The start of the troubles**
- *Civil disobedience* and non-violent resistance
- Riots in urban areas (e.g. in the cities of Belfast and Derry/Londonderry)
- The British army was sent to NI to bring more stability to the region
- Political and military decisions *Radicalized* elements of the nationalists/republican communities and made more people sympathetic to those who wished to use violence to achieve their aims (basically the army didn't see themselves as belonging to either side, but that they were just trying to retain peace, but eventually the army started to pick sides and started shooting and killing civilians themselves. )
- Unionist/loyalist organizations responded by saying they would do whatever was necessary to protect their communities and culture

**1972 The worst year of the troubles** (these are all by republicans)
- 497 people killed 
	- 5000 injured
	- 2000 explosions, 10.000 shootings
- Bloody Sunday
	- 26 protesters shot
	- 13 killed on that day, another 1 died afterwards
- Bloody Friday
	- 22 bombs in 75min
	- 9 killed, 130 with life-altering changes
- Claudy bombing
	- 3 bombs on the main street of a small rural village 
	- 9 killed including an 8 year old girl
- Aldershot bombing
- IRA attack in UK mainland
- 7 killed, 19 got life-altering changes

Organizations like the IRA wanted to act like the protectors of their local communities. Sometimes you wouldn't see guards around the cities, but IRA members with shotguns, because they didn't trust the authorities.
