**Past continuous je na slikici narobe** prav bi blo I was at school

tense $\neq$ time
We use the past tense as the present in conditionals (if I won the lottery I'd buy a house (now))
We use the future tense as the present when ???

**Future in the past:** I was going to do xy Izražamo nekaj kar je bilo v preteklosti prihodnost (npr. če bom čez 5 let govorila kaj sem hotela študirat zdaj)
	Baje je razlika med past continuous pa tem to, da v past continuous rečeš was listening v past in the future pa was going to listen (slikica narobe?)

going to = more certain
will = you are still deciding/it's based on your personal opinion

With present perfect you dont need any aditional context
I *have been* studiying for 10h, (so I *am* tired). Ne rabiš nujno tega v oklepaju
With past perfect you need aditional context
I *had been* studiying for 10h so i *was* tired. Rabiš ta i was tired del
